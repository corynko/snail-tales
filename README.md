# Snail Tales

Snail Tales is a vue and lesscss based site for connecting players together for epistolary RPG experiences

## What the fuck is an epistolary RPG?

Fair question! Epistolary - or play-by-post - RPG's are a type of physical, role-playing and/or world-building game played with multiple players via letters, emails, shouting from the tops of very tall mountains, etc. There are [many, many frameworks available](https://itch.io/physical-games/tag-epistolary) (including two by me!), each with unique settings, characters, and challenges. This setting and these characters are developed and explored through the letters you write to your partner(s).

### Can I use this code?

This code is open-source and free to use, but be aware that I am very much learning Vue as I make this application, and you may well want to steer far clear of the codebase. That said, all photos, logos, creative assets, and other IP, unless otherwise marked, is the sole property of Ethan Kotel and may not be used without permission. Don't hesitate to ask, though!
